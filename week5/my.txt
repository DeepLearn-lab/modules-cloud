Thanks for the response.
For the references to "time", I have the similar concern as you, but it's not easy to find one which is abstract and explicit.

In real world, and in the context of CNN, 3D data usually means 3D volume or 2D movie. For 3D volume, it's spatial signal. And for movie, it's spatio-temporal signal. Names such as "first_spatial_dim", "second_spatial_dim" etc. would not apply in the case of a movie, because, time dimension for a movie is not the "first spatial dim", it's a temporal dim.
